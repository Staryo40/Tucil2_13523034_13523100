## Image Compression and Processing with Quadtree Method
Image compression and processing is an essential procedure to do in the current digital era. As such, there are a lot methods that have been developed to achieve image compression. But in this project, Quadtree, a tree-type data structure, was utilized to achieve the result. This method is unique in using the tree data structure with each node having four nodes. This is beneficial in image processing as its dimension can be large and needs to be explored in an efficient way. The split at every depth into four different other nodes minimizes quality loss while also maximizing compression that is efficient in process with the max depth for day-to-day images not far from 10.

This program is a showcase of the Divide and Conquer algorithm, an algorithm that divides the problem to smaller but similar problems and at the end combines the solution of these small problems to ultimately find the solution of the original problem.

## Program Requirements
1. .NET SDK
2. SixLabors.ImageSharp Library  
## Compiling the Program
Navigate to the directory that contains bin, doc, src, and test (root directory)
Then run the line below to compile the main program and place the .exe and .dll in the bin folder
```bash
dotnet build src --output bin
```  
## Running the Program
Run the line below to run the program
```bash
dotnet bin/src.dll
```
If the line above does not work, try to compile the program before running the line again.
